Color Hexdump
=============

I got tired of hexdump being not in color. Now it's in color.

Screen shot?
------------

Here's what it looks like:

![chexdump pdfa.pdf][pdfa]

This is a PDF where some binary data showed up. In regular hexdump, that
data would have just been a buncha dots over on the right. But now, it's
a buncha colorful letters, wow

To do
-----

It'd be cool if it could take command line arguments to like, display
only a given byte range of a file, or something. Maybe I'll do that
next.
