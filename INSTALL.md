Installation
============

I didn't go crazy here because this program isn't very complicated. To
compile:

    $ make

To install:

    mv chexdump /usr/local/bin

Replace `/usr/local/bin` with whatever thing in your `$PATH` you'd
rather have `chexdump` in. I'm not writing an entire `configure` just so
that you can run `make install` instead.

Linux

I have only tested this on two linux machines. Good luck??
